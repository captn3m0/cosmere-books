![Books in the Cosmere](https://i.imgur.com/NymmBq4.png)

Scripts to generate books from the [Cosmere](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere) using various public sources. Currently supports the following books:

**Books**

1.  Wind and Truth (being serialized till Chapter 30, In Progress)

1.  Oathbringer (Serialized till Chapter 32)

**Tor.com Rereads**
1.  Way of Kings Reread
1.  Words of Radiance Reread
1.  Edgedancer Reread
1.  Oathbringer Reread

For obvious reasons, the converted ebooks are not part of this repo. You must download and run the script on your own machine to generate the ebook files.

## Requirements

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed.

## Generation

**Instructions are available for [Windows](https://github.com/captn3m0/cosmere-books/wiki/Running-on-Windows), [Mac](https://github.com/captn3m0/cosmere-books/wiki/Running-on-Mac), and [Linux](https://github.com/captn3m0/cosmere-books/wiki/Running-on-Linux)**.

## Book Codes

```
dark-one
edgedancer-reread
mythwalker
oathbringer
oathbringer-reread
row
skyward
wok-reread
wor-reread
lost-metal
```

If none is passed, all books will be generated. The entire build (for all books combined) roughly takes 15 minutes on a single core system (excluding the Docker pull). Generating the `defending-elysium` ebook requires generating all ebooks currently.

As an example, you'd like to get a ebook for Rhythm of War, run the following command:

  docker run --rm --volume "$(pwd):/output" captn3m0/cosmere-books:latest row

For directions specific to your OS, see above.

We know you can't wait for the book to finally hit shelves on 11/6/18, so we're releasing new chapters here every week!

See more details at [underlined](https://www.getunderlined.com/read/excerpt-reveal-start-reading-skyward-by-brandon-sanderson/) or [brandonsanderson.com](https://brandonsanderson.com/books/skyward/skyward/). This covers Chapters 1-15 of the book.

## Defending Elysium

> This story originally appeared in the October/November 2008 Asimov’s Science Fiction (in the US) and the UPC Science Fiction collection (in Europe). It was winner of the UPC science fiction award, and was the last short story Brandon wrote before he sold Elantris to Tor.

> The story was first named honorable mention in a Writers of the Future contest in early 2003. (Brandon got the phone call from an editor buying Elantris in April 2003.) A few years later, he did a couple of serious revisions of the story and then submitted it to the UPC award in Spain. It won first place, and subsequently sold in the US to Asimov’s Science Fiction—which was Brandon’s first (and so far only) fiction appearance in a major print magazine. It was given an honorable mention in Gardner Dozois’s The Year’s Best Science Fiction anthology for 2008.

## Dark One

>Brandon Sanderson’s Dark One is a break from the norm; it’s a graphic novel from Vault Comics, originally announced as being in the works two years ago, based on an original idea from Sanderson. The book will be written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing from a story by Sanderson, with art by Nathan Gooden and colors from Kurt Michael Russell. Lettering on the project comes from Deron Bennett.

>The chapter below was originally intended to be Vault Comics’ Free Comic Book Day release this year.

## Warbreaker Prime: Mythwalker

Below description from [Sanderson's website](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/warbreaker-prime-mythwalker-prologue/), written by Peter:

>When Brandon shelved Mythwalker in August 2001 because he felt it wasn’t working (one of its issues was that it felt clichéd, but there are other issues that I’ll discuss following later chapters), he planned to get back to it eventually. But there were still elements and characters left over in those books that could be used to tell other stories. Warbreaker follows one of the storylines from Mythwalker that was left when the elements used in the Mistborn trilogy were taken out. But that is not all that Mythwalker is. Its main character and its magic system have not been cannibalized. What you will read here [...] is an interesting story in its own right, even though it has problems. And some of you will be frustrated that the story remains unfinished.
>
>So it is probably best to view these chapters just as a window on early Brandon Sanderson, when he tried something and failed. This was the first novel in Brandon’s adult writing career that he started writing but never finished. If you want insight into his creative process, I think this is a great place to look.

## The Lost Metal

> Tor.com is serializing The Lost Metal from now until its release on November 15. New chapters will go live every Monday at 12pm ET.

In progress, only Chapter 1 so far.
