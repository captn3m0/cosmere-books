![Books in the Cosmere](https://i.imgur.com/NymmBq4.png)

Scripts to generate books from the [Cosmere]() using various public sources. Currently supports the following books:

1.  Oathbringer (Serialized till Chapter 32)
2.  Way of Kings Reread
3.  Words of Radiance Reread
4.  Edgedancer Reread
5.  Way of Kings Prime
6.  Oathbringer Reread

For obvious reasons, the converted ebooks are not part of this repo. You must download
and run the script on your own machine to generate the copies.

The code for this is mostly adapted from [hoshruba](https://github.captnemo.in/hoshruba).

You can download sample files (Lorem Ipsum) from <http://ge.tt/8R61oXm2> to see a sample of how the generated files look.

## Oathbringer

Tor.com is publishing Oathbringer in serialized form till Chapter 32. This script
downloads all of these posts and converts them into a publishable format, including
epub, mobi, pdf and html. You can find the tor.com announcement at https://www.tor.com/2017/08/15/brandon-sanderson-oathbringer-serialization-announcement/.

The script figures out all the chapter URLs, so I just run it every Tuesday now (it doesn't need updates).

## Way of Kings Reread

Join Michael Pye (aka The Mad Hatter) and Carl Engle-Laird as they dive into the details of Sanderson’s complex new world of Roshar.

## Words of Radiance Reread

Welcome to the reread of Brandon Sanderson’s second Stormlight Archive series book Words of Radiance! This reread will be a collaborative effort between Tor.com’s own editorial assistant Carl Engle-Laird and long-time Tor.com commenter and Sanderson beta-reader Alice Arneson. This new partnership promises to be as potent as that between spren and Radiant. Join them in the Storm Cellar as they evaluate, discuss, question, and generally kibitz their way through the Words of Radiance.

## Edgedancer Reread

Join Alice Arneson and Lyndsey Luther for a reread of Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere novella, Edgedancer, which fills in some of the details for Lift and Nalan between their appearances in Words of Radiance and the next time we see them in Oathbringer.

## Way of Kings: Prime

> For it([Altered Perceptions anthology](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/altered-perceptions)), I’m letting people see—for the first time—a large chunk of the original version of The Way of Kings, which I wrote in 2002–2003. This version is very different, and involves a different course in life for Kaladin as a character—all due to a simple decision he makes one way in this book, but a completely different way in the published novel.

> These chapters are quite fun, as I consider what happened in The Way of Kings Prime (as I now call it) to be an "alternate reality" version of the events in the published books. The characters are almost all exactly the same people, but their backstories are different, and that has transformed who they are and how they react to the world around them. Roshar is similar, yet wildly different, as this was before I brought in the spren as a major world element.
